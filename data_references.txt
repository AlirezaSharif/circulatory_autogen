# This document details the references specified in the data_reference entry of the parameters.csv file

to_find_reference:        value has been obtained from data, I need to find the
                          paper/datasource where this value was obtained.

defined_by_user:          This is a parameter that the user defines, if not defined, the original value
                          is the assumption, e.g the period T is assumed to be 1.0 s if it is not 
                          redefined by the user.

ANS_control_parameter:    This parameter is modified by the ANS control system, leave it as 1.0 and the 
                          changing of it needs to be done in the Python code. If there is no ANS control 
                          implemented this stays as 1.0 and ANS control doesn't occur.

to_be_identified:         This parameter is not physiological! It must be identified from data       

#####_identified:         This parameter has been identified from data with ###### being the data
                          that data identification occured. 
                          Each date will be a reference to a specific data source which will
                          be detailed in a separate file. TODO

ADAN                      obtained from the ADAN model see paper {TODO}. This value has either been
                          obtained directly from the ADAN model, or in the case of nominal terminal flows,
                          the flows of non-modelled terminals in the area have been summed to get the value
                          for this terminal. e.g v_nom_leg_L is the sum of v_nom
